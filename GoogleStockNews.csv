Hasmukh A Thakkar

Tata Steel (₹1,023.5): The stock price made a clear top at ₹1,534.6 in August last year. It has tumbled over 33 per cent from its high. The trend has reversed. The outlook is bearish now. The stock has room to fall further from here. Resistance will be in the ₹1,050-1,100 region. This has been capping the upside over the last couple of weeks. Immediate support is at ₹960. Tata Steel is more likely to break this support. Such a break can drag it down to ₹892 – the 61.8-per cent Fibonacci retracement support level. A break below ₹892 will see an extended fall to ₹785.

If you are holding this stock, it is better to exit at current levels. Wait for a fall to buy the stock again. For those considering entering this stock, buy 40 per cent of the intended amount at ₹910. Buy the rest at ₹810. The average purchase price will then be at ₹850. Keep a stop-loss at ₹680. Move the stop-loss to ₹960 when the stock price rises to ₹1,150. Exit the position at ₹1,500. A fresh rally from either ₹892 itself or from ₹785 will have the potential to take the price up to ₹1,500 levels again over the long term.

I am holding shares of Shanti Gears at ₹230. What is the short and long-term outlook?

Shoeb Khan

Shanthi Gears (₹223.5): The stock came off sharply last week after hovering around a crucial long-term resistance level of ₹240. The price action on the weekly chart indicates that the stock has been struggling to breach ₹240 decisively over the last several weeks. So, you have to be very cautious as the chances are high to see a sharp correction. An immediate support is at ₹220. A break below it will increase the danger of the stock falling to ₹180 or ₹165 over the medium term. If you can withstand the loss, keep a stop-loss at ₹215 and hold it. If a bounce from ₹220 happens, then look to exit the stock at ₹285.

On the other hand, if your stop-loss is hit, then wait for a fall and buy the stock again at ₹185 and ₹170. For this position, keep the stop-loss at ₹135 and hold it. Trail the stop-loss up to ₹190 as soon as the stock moves up to ₹230. Move the stop-loss further up to ₹240 when the price reaches ₹260. Exit the stock at ₹300.

I am holding shares of Kalpataru Power Transmission at ₹386. What is the medium- and long-term outlook? Can we accumulate the stocks? If so, at what levels?

S. Rekha

Kalpataru Power Transmission (₹364.45): The stock has been in a downtrend since August last year. Within this downtrend, there is a strong resistance around ₹400. A near-term support is at ₹320. Even if the stock manages to hold above ₹320, it must rise past ₹400 to ease the downside pressure. But that looks less probable as seen from the chart. There is a strong likelihood of the stock breaking below ₹320 in the coming weeks. Such a break can drag the price down to ₹240-220 in the next six months or so. Thereafter, a fresh long-term rally can begin targeting ₹500 and even ₹500 levels over the next couple of years.

If you intend to hold this stock for the long term, you will need a lot of patience to withstand the loss. Wait for a fall and accumulate at ₹245 and ₹225. Keep a stop-loss at ₹170. Move the stop-loss up to ₹310 as soon as the stock rises to ₹440. Revise the stop-loss further up to ₹490, as soon as the stock touches ₹540 on the upside. Exit the stock at ₹580.","A fresh rally from either ₹892 itself or from ₹785 will have the potential to take the price up to ₹1,500 levels again over the long term.

BusinessLine,Which steel stock can weather the upcoming headwinds?,https://news.google.com./articles/CAIiEL0trVZ1GunKtPTb3Pxr98cqGQgEKhAIACoHCAownZiCCzDY7_4CMKnDzAY?uo=CAUimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vcG9ydGZvbGlvL3N0b2NrLWZ1bmRhbWVudGFsLWFuYWx5c2lzLWluZGlhL3doaWNoLXN0ZWVsLXN0b2NrLWNhbi13ZWF0aGVyLXRoZS11cGNvbWluZy1oZWFkd2luZHMvYXJ0aWNsZTY1NDkxMjQxLmVjZdIBAA&hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,"Steel companies and the metals universe have powered Nifty/Sensex earnings turnaround post Covid, owing to higher commodity prices. But owing to recent 180 degrees change in global macro environment including increase in bond yields/ lending rates, inflation, and economic outlook, a closer view of steel stocks may be necessary. We have analysed Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) on the four parameters for a comparison. Tata Steel’s higher spreads (revenue and cost), better access to European markets and lower relative valuation makes it a better stock amongst the lot. On a contrarian view though, SAIL and JSPL have opportunities to improve product mix and realise better valuations going forward. But the bumper earnings of FY22 may only be repeated beyond FY24 in the current commodity situation.

Spread

Efficiency measure: spread or EBITDA per tonne, is the difference between realisation (per ton of sales) and cost (operating cost per ton) where operating cost is a function of raw materials (around half), and employee (6-10 per cent) and other related expenses (around 40 per cent).

Standalone operations account for more than 95 per cent of SAIL and JSPL consolidated operations and 82 per cent of JSW Steel operations but only 52 per cent of Tata Steel. We are comparing on a standalone basis to focus on domestic markets operations where , Tata Steel followed by JSW Steel have better realisations (₹70-73,000 per ton as on Q4FY22) compared to SAIL and Jindal steel (₹65-66,000 per ton). A higher mix of value-added products drives better realizations, which SAIL is implementing currently by improving long steel contribution compared to semi-finished product mix. For comparison though, in Q3FY21, the quarter after Covid had struck and companies had recovered their production schedule, the average realisation was around ₹48,000 per ton with very little variation amongst the four companies.

On the cost side, Tata Steel and Jindal Steel operate at lower cost per ton (around 48,000 per tonne in Q4FY22) compared to the other two at ₹56,000 per tonne. Coking coal which accounts for 60-65 per cent of raw material costs have increased drastically. As a result, operating costs have increased by an average 40 per cent from H1FY22 to H2FY22 across the four. Russia Ukraine conflict has added to the higher coking coal prices with import duty reduction offering only a minor cost offset to the companies.

The outlook on spread seems to be narrowing for the companies. With the implementation of export duty on steel, the domestic spot prices have already declined 8 per cent to ₹65,000 per tonne in May for hot rolled coil steel and expectation is for further decline. On the cost side, coking coal imports are expected to be higher even into Q1FY23. With spread narrowing to ₹8,000-9000 for the weakest of the four largest players (SAIL in Q4FY22), export duty implementation by government will have to consider the efficiency of other smaller steel manufacturers as well, which places a clock on the duties timeframe. But overall on the longer term, higher steel prices are expected to be above last cycle considering curtailed Chinese participation in export of steel (environmental concerns) and lower dependence of Europe on Russian coking coal imports.

Exports

Higher export demand and prices have aided companies in the last one year, which has been dampened by the duty imposition. Jindal Steel has had the highest exposure to export market, averaging around 33-35 per cent in the last two years. The company has indicated that its export mix may continue similarly by focusing on pockets of products without export duty. Similarly, JSW Steel expects to maintain exports at 15-20 per cent despite the duty. But companies, having to bear the export duty, will take a call on the export-domestic mix depending prices emerging in the next few periods. Tata Steel with strong European presence (with Corus Steel) with standalone operations contributing to only 52 per cent of consolidated top line and SAIL with low 9 per cent export revenue contribution are placed well with regard to export duty imposition.

But tepid domestic demand and its capacity to accommodate higher allocation, even with lower pricing, seems to be major headwind for all producers till export duties are lifted. Auto, OEM manufacturers and infrastructure companies are the largest consumers of steel.

Capex and leverage

Steel companies have deleveraged significantly from an average net-debt/EBITDA of 4.8 times on March-2020 to 0.9x on March-2022. While the quantum of debt is lower, the increasing cost of debt and lower spreads from operations can lead to interest costs taking 15-18 per cent of EBITDA compared to 10 per cent earlier (when realisations were higher and operating costs were lower), unless companies continue to de-lever consistently. Tata steel with highest spreads is better placed amongst the lot to maintain interest costs at 8-9 per cent of EBITDA. SAIL and Jindal Steel targets to be debt free by FY23 may be complicated by decreasing spreads.

On the other hand, capex plans are at a higher level and few companies have reiterated the plans even after import duty announcement and lower spread outlook. China’s lower participation in steel exports may have encouraged such positioning. SAIL, JSW Steel and Tata Steel have budgeted between ₹8,000 crore and ₹20,000 crore for capex in the next year alone with a significant increase in output by 15-20 per cent. Considering the volatile environment, Jindal Steel with spread out investment schedule over three years (₹18,500 crore) may be better placed amongst the four. If the spreads continue to decline, companies may have to step off the gas on capex considering targets to deleverage.

Valuations

Companies trade at a discount in steel up-cycles and this cycle is no different with top line growth of 35 per cent across the four companies in Q4FY22. Measured as premium to last five-year average EV/EBITDA less 2 standard deviations, SAIL, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel are trading at 13-15 per cent premium. Only Tata Steel is trading near to two standard deviations below average currently. Also, one should consider the highest input prices witnessed by the industry baked into the lower EBITDA expectations providing further cushion to valuations.","While the quantum of debt is lower, the increasing cost of debt and lower spreads from operations can lead to interest costs taking 15-18 per cent of EBITDA compared to 10 per cent earlier (when realisations were higher and operating costs were lower), unless companies continue to de-lever consistently.

Buy / Sell Tata Steel share TRADE

Steel stocks gained on Monday outperforming in an otherwise weak market as the reduction in prices of key raw materials boosted sentiment for the sector. Shares of JSW Steel, Jindal Steel & Power Ltd and Tata Steel gained by up to 3 percent in trade on Monday.

The sentiment turned positive as prices of iron ore and coking coal, key raw materials used in steel production, have fallen sharply in the last 10 days, while the reopening of Chinese cities after weeks of coronavirus-induced lockdowns improved the demand outlook.

State-owned National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) has slashed iron ore prices twice in a span of 10 days, reducing its prices by around 25 percent, while the cost of coking coal has also softened by $80 in the past 10 days. Coking coal, also known as metallurgical coal, is used to create coke, one of the key irreplaceable inputs for the production of steel.

NMDC shares, however, slipped 4.5 percent as the price cut comes at a time when demand is expected to pick up as major Chinese cities reopen, dampening sentiment in the ore supplier stock.

The company's profits are set to be under stress after the government recently raised export duty on iron ore and now the price cut adds to woes. The January-March quarter results showed NMDC's operating margins had suffered sharp erosion owing to lower realisations and higher expenses. Even the Bank of America report had highlighted these concerns and pointed at significant downside risks.

Meanwhile, industry sources told CNBC-TV18 that the government is trying to rein in inflation by cooling the domestic steel market. A further fall in raw material price will lead to fall of Rs 3000 to Rs 5000 per tonne in steel price, they added.

Even though there was buying on the street, Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities is not “optimistic” about the sector.

“Correction in raw material prices certainly will benefit steel companies in managing their margins considering realisations are lower. But considering where these stocks are trading at this point of time, and volumes also are flattening out, the export opportunity is limited because of the export duty,” Mehta told CNBC-TV18.

A downturn in the commodity cycle could be detrimental, Mehta added.

“And with the way inflation is going and all the corrective action being taken, you could expect a downturn in the commodity cycle and that could be detrimental for steel stocks. So I would like to avoid steel stocks at this point of time.”

Hemang Jani, Retail Equity Strategist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services too feels that duty on exports will remain a dampener for steel stocks.

“Correction in input prices of steel does provide short term tactical up move for names like JSW Steel and few other companies because you might have a case where the spreads are looking a bit better than what they were few weeks back. However, given the fact that we have such an important decision on the duty front and the fact that prices could remain a bit subdued, I do not see a reason why we should have a very aggressive positive view on metals at this point of time. However because the sector has corrected, you might see a bit of pop here and there.”","Buy / Sell Tata Steel share TRADE Steel stocks gained on Monday outperforming in an otherwise weak market as the reduction in prices of key raw materials boosted sentiment for the sector.

The BSE Sensex is currently trading at 54,303.44, down roughly 5% from its 52-week low, while the Nifty is down 4.85% from its 52-week low. As a result, after most stocks hit all-time lows, the upcoming correction phase may urge you to purchase on the dip. So, here are three bluechip stocks to watch next week that are priced at a more than 30% discount to their 52-week high.

Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra, one of the IT behemoths, has a market capitalization of ₹107,936.06 crore. The stock's last traded price on the NSE was ₹1,110.25, a 2.51% decline from its previous close. The stock has dropped 1.08 per cent in the previous five trading days and 7.66 per cent in the last month. The last traded price of Tech Mahindra's shares is now lower than the 5 days, 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. The stock has gained by 3.84 per cent in the last year, while it has fallen by 37.80 per cent year to date (YTD) so far in 2022. The stock reached a 52-week high of ₹1,838.00 on December 30, 2021, and a 52-week low of ₹1,030.10 on July 7, 2021, indicating that it is now trading 7.75 per cent above its 52-week low and 39.6 per cent below its 52-week-high. Buyers should be aware that the promoter holdings of 35.26 per cent are low in comparison to the previous five years, but Tech Mahindra has announced an equity dividend of 900.00 per cent equating to ₹45 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2022. This amounts to a dividend yield of 4.05 per cent at the current share price of ₹1110.25.

Tata Steel

Tata Steel Ltd is a large cap company with a market capitalization of ₹125,039.33 Crore that operates in the metal industry. The stock's last traded price was ₹1,023, a 2.09 per cent fall from its previous closing of ₹1044.85. The stock has dropped 2.80 per cent in the previous five days and 6.75 per cent in the last month. The stock has fallen 12.21 per cent in the last six months and 12.17 per cent in the last year.

The stock reached a 52-week high of ₹1,534.50 on August 16, 2021 and a 52-week low of ₹991.80 on May 25, 2022, indicating that Tata Steel is now up 3.14 percent from its 52-week low and down 33.33 percent from its 52-week high. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman implemented customs duties on steel, which might be one of the reasons for the stock's downfall. Tata Steel has declared a huge dividend of ₹51 per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, however, the stock is also trading at 1.08 times its book value.

Wipro

Wipro is a well-known large-cap global corporation in the IT sector, with a market capitalization of ₹252,707 Cr.

The stock has dropped 28.54 per cent in the previous six months and 17.88 per cent in the last year. So far in 2022, the stock has dropped 35.83 per cent year to date (YTD). Wipro is trading lower than its 5-day, 20-day, 50 days, 100 day, and 200-day moving averages, and its RSI indicator value as of 10/06/2022 is 39.80, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold. On the NSE, the stock reached a 52-week high of ₹739.85 on October 14, 2021 and a low of ₹443.20 on May 25, 2022, indicating that the stock is trading above 4.06 per cent of its 52-week low and 37.66 per cent below its 52-week high.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 4.8%.

Tata Steel's Earnings Easily Cover the Distributions

We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. However, Tata Steel's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.

Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 34.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 31%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.

NSEI:TATASTEEL Historic Dividend June 4th 2022

Dividend Volatility

The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from ₹12.00 to ₹51.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 16% over that duration. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Tata Steel has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 35% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.

We Really Like Tata Steel's Dividend

In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

Agencies

NEW DELHI: Investors are always searching for profit multipliers at an attractive price. But finding such names is not easy. A cursory screening of stocks that have declared results in the March quarter throws up 19 names that have more than doubled their profits in the last two years.They are Tata Steel, Info Edge (India),, CSB Bank,& Minerals,, Hindware Home Innovation,, Xpro India andSome of them are obvious names, especially those that have benefitted from the commodity boom in the last couple of years. A few of them are little known names that have surprised investors and analysts.Their performance is remarkable as it has come at a time when rising inflation has put pressure on margins and ultimately bottomline of companies. This is apparent from the depression in share prices as these stocks are trading at 20-50 per cent lower compared to their 52-week high prices.“Persistent higher inflation and rates may also adversely impact demand, margins, and hence corporate earnings. This is already reflecting in earnings downgrades outweighing upgrades in India with nearly 3 in 4 stocks seeing earnings being revised downwards,” said SBI Mutual Fund in a recent note.Now the question is, should you buy the above mentioned stocks? Analysts believe here you should become picky. Even though they are available at a deep discount , and they have performed remarkably well, the outlook for each of them could be different.For instance, shares of steel companies fell sharply recently after the government increased tariffs on exports. This is expected to hit their sales and profits. Though, some analysts say market reaction was too extreme and a value is emerging in them.""Metal prices had crashed following the widespread Chinese lockdowns. To make matters worse, the government of India imposed export duties on certain categories like steel and iron ore. This depressed domestic prices and led to a near 30 percent crash in stock prices of metal majors. Now the situation is slowly improving,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at“Chinese opening up has improved supply chains and also raised the demand for metals. So prices are looking up. But so long as export duties remain, metal stocks are unlikely to rally beyond a point. But it is a fact that stock prices had over-reacted on the downside. This may be partly corrected.""Among the above-mentioned names, consensus rating on Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless and Nalco hovers between buy and strong buy. Average target prices signal 30-120 per cent upside in them in the next 12 months.Info Edge is another name that analysts are bullish on given India is emerging out of the pandemic strongly, and the booming internet market is set to benefit the companies and brands it operates. The company has delivered 556 per cent and 237 per cent profit growth in FY22 and FY21, respectively.

That said, the brokerage house believes JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) and Shyam Metalics are likely to benefit from the steep fall in domestic steel prices while Tata Steel is expected to gain from relatively high coking coal proportion and contracts.

The brokerage has maintained its cautious outlook on the ferrous space with ‘Reduce’ rating on JSW Steel (target price: ₹471) and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) with target price of ₹57, whereas it has ‘Hold’ on JSPL (TP: ₹385) and Tata Steel (TP: ₹985).

Meanwhile, Shyam Metalics has remained Edelweiss' sole ‘Buy’ in the ferrous space, benefitting from lower iron ore prices and nil export duty on ferroalloys (17% revenue), and has a target price of ₹353 on the metal stock.

“Going ahead, while we await demand to pick up, we view the sharp spike in steel and aluminium exports cautiously. This suggests the government might go slow on reining in exports if demand stays subdued. We retain our cautious stance on the ferrous space with a ‘BUY’ only on Shyam Metalics,"" the note stated.

The brokerage is particularly cautious on demand outlook as a renewed lockdown of one district in Shanghai has raised concerns that the full reopening of the financial centre could be delayed by a resurgence in cases.

“We view China’s trade data as double-edged. On the one hand, increased copper and iron ore imports point to a possible revival in demand and, on the other, recordhigh Al exports and significantly high steel exports undermine the oft-stated policy of reining in exports in order to reduce carbon footprint,"" Edelweiss added.

If Al/steel exports continue to remain at high level, in the event of weakness in domestic demand persisting, there might be that prices of these commodities coming under pressure.

Equity markets globally remained impacted by worries on rising interest rates, elevated crude oil prices and liquidity tightening – which kept the market both volatile as well as jitter. markets registered losses in the last five trading days, Nifty closing at 16201 and Sensex closing at 54303, logging their first weekly losses in a month as elevated crude oil prices and mounting concerns over global monetary policy tightening eroded risk appetite. Rupee also made a all-time low 77.83 but in the last few sessions it has been very resilient and is consolidating in a narrow range despite volatility in domestic and global equities and strength in the dollar against its major crosses

The week gone by was a volatile one for stock markets as the Reserve Bank of India announced a 50-basis-point rate hike and clearly hinted at even tighter financial conditions going ahead, given elevated domestic inflation. Going forward, all eyes on the major event of the week FOMC meet on 15th June. The FOMC, which has already raised its benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 75 basis points since March 2015, is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points each in June and July, given soaring inflation in the US. The rapid pace at which interest rates and bond yields are climbing in the US increases the risk of more overseas outflows from Indian assets, as returns on financial assets in the world’s largest economy become more attractive.

The earnings season continues to remain healthy and provides a silver lining to the otherwise volatile and challenging environment. Overall for FY22, Nifty delivered an EPS of Rs733, a growth of 35% which is highest since FY04. We are now expecting 18%/16% growth in Nifty’s FY23/FY24 earnings to Rs864/Rs1002 respectively driven by BFSI, IT, O&G and Auto sectors. Nifty is currently trading around 19x FY23 PE which is at a marginal discount to its 10-year average P/E of 19.4x. However, Nifty Midcap 100 trades at around 18% premium to Nifty at 22x PE. Thus, we find more value in large-caps than mid-caps given this relative valuation equation. That said, we believe that continued earnings delivery is crucial for markets to hold amidst several global and macro headwinds.

Technically, the index has held its key support levels of 15735 and formed a short term bottom followed by consolidation and range breakout. On daily scale, it has given a breakout of the consolidation zone above 16400 and has been sustaining at higher levels. The momentum oscillator RSI has bounced from the oversold zone and is positively placed which could fuel the up move. Considering the overall chart structure, we are expecting the index to witness the buying interest on any small decline towards key support zones to extend the bounce towards 17000 level. Now, the index is expected to move to higher levels and a decisive hold of 16400 zones may see an up move towards 17000 and 17250 zones. While on the flipside, key supports are placed at 16061 and 15735 zones.
